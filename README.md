# 🐍 Pythonic Practice

This is my personal space for learning and practicing **idiomatic Python** — writing code that's clean, elegant, and "Pythonic."

## ✨ Goals

- Improve Python fluency
- Practice list comprehensions, generator expressions, and idioms
- Refactor basic code into more elegant versions
- Explore useful standard libraries (`itertools`, `collections`, etc.)

## 📁 Structure

- `comprehensions/` – practice with list/set/dict comprehensions
- `idioms/` – examples using `enumerate`, `zip`, unpacking, etc.
- `refactoring/` – converting basic loops and conditions to Pythonic forms

## 🧪 How I Use It

- Write small code snippets
- Solve short challenges
- Refactor messy code
- Keep notes on useful patterns

This repo is for personal learning. Feel free to get ideas but don’t expect polished code.
